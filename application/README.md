## Custom Glean SDK distribution

When working on a bug fix for the Python bindings for the Glean SDK, you may
wish to replace the glean-sdk wheel installed in the burnham Docker image
with a custom distribution.

Bump the glean-sdk version identifier before you build a wheel distribution
and then update the [Dockerfile][dockerfile] to copy the wheel into the
Docker image:

```text
COPY --from=wheels /wheels/*.whl /tmp/wheels/

# Copy custom distribution to temporary wheels directory in image
COPY glean_sdk-31.2.1-cp36-abi3-manylinux1_x86_64.whl /tmp/wheels/
```

Then make sure that the version requirement for the Python bindings for the
Glean SDK in [burnham setup.py][setup.py] matches your custom distribution.

```text
install_requires=["click>=7.0", "glean-sdk==31.2.1", "wrapt", "typing_extensions"]
```

When you build the burnham Docker image you should now see a message that pip
installed your custom glean-sdk wheel in the log.
